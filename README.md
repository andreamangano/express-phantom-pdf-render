# Render PDF Service with ExpressJS and PhantomJS

#### [Note: Work in progress.]

This test project aims to generate a PDF starting from a URL using **ExpressJS** and **PhatomJS**.

In particular, it was born to meet the needs of real project I worked on for my company. The goal was to build a service (on a server Node) to build a final report (pdf) from an angular application with no persistent data.
